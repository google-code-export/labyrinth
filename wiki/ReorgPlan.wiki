#summary Plans for reorganising development after 0.5 release

  # Decide on distributed hosting platform:
    * Github - popular
    * Bitbucket - common in Python circles, hg has a nice GUI (tortoisehg)
    * Google Code - Already using it, could migrate to Git or Hg. But it's less popular and doesn't offer pull requests.
  # Migrate to new hosting/VCS
  # Update code to use Gtk 3
  # Simplify build system
  # Refactoring and reorganisation
  # Port to Python 3?
