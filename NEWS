v0.1
----
New features:

   * Saves window title, current mode, geometry and placement of window

   * Drag a link from a current parent to a current child to strengthen the link by 1

   * No more parent-child relationship in code

v0.0.5
------

New features:
 * Menubar and toolbar added.  Beginnings of a user-interface.  Yay!
 * Allow multiple Labyrinth windows to open at the same time
 * Added an About dialog
 * Allow windows to be closed (ctrl-W) or quit the app (ctrl-Q).  Also from the menu.
 * Different modes:
   * Move Mode allows you to drag thoughts around and delete them with the delete / backspace key.
   * Edit Mode</b> allows you to enter new thoughts, edit old thoughts and link up thoughts.
 * Deletion of nodes.  Either through delete / backspace key in Move Mode or by menu item in any mode.  Note, when no node is selected, this silently fails.  The menu item is always sensitive.
 * Massive code rework.  Code is now cleaner than before and easier to work with. (Of course, it will likely be screwed with again before becoming serious)
 * Window title becomes Primary Thought content.  If no primary thought, default to "Untitled Map %d"
 * Break Install
