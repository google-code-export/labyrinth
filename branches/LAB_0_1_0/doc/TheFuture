Labyrinth - Future Work
---------

v0.1
----

Version 0.1 of Labyrinth was all about getting a basic working thing.

Loading and saving work and not a lot else.

v0.2
----

I'm following the "cairo" model here.  Basically, the new version will be released when the "Required Features" are in place, in a usable form.  Any "Desired Features" are a plus.  New "Required" and "Desired" features are made very near release of previous version.

Required Features:
* Beginnings of a "drawing" thought
  - Allow the user to add purty pictures to their maps
  - How?
    > Current thought is to have a new mode - "Drawing Mode"
    > When selected and somewhere (empty!) is clicked on a map, a new window opens
    > This window allows the user to scribble in it with the mouse
    > When closed, the resulting picture is added to the map as a node
  - Alternatively
    > When in drawing mode, the user can scribble anywhere on the map
    > The resulting image becomes a node when exiting drawing mode
  - Alternatively (2)
    > As above, but a very light border is shown where the node extends
    > User can draw the border bigger or smaller
    > Drawing is finished when clicking outside the area
  - All have disadvantages and advantages.  Which one to go for?  Dunno
* Icon and menu entry
* Beginning of i18n support

Desired Features:
* Alternate text sizes
  - Ideally, text should (in the first instance) follow the theme size
  - Additional text sizes available from a drop-down list
* Follow theme
  - Should check which theme is running and follow the colours defined in it
* Colourful thoughts
  - Should be able to select fg / bg colours for thoughts
* Accessibility
  - Figure out a way to display all the thoughts in a completely accessible way
  - Use a tree-view?
  - Figure out how to make thoughts actually add (accessibly) to the map area
* Icon and menu entry
* Beginning of i18n support


To infinity and beyond
----------------------

Some ideas for later versions.  These are planned for some point, just not right now.

* Export
  - Export maps as png / pdf / print / XML
  - Allow import as well (from XML)
* Different thought types
  - "Elegant" (only 2 sides have thin border), "Jazzy" (huge great spikes out of it), cloud (fluffy) etc.
    > I know what they look like in my head and thats enough for me
* Grouping of thoughts
  - Select multiple thoughts
  - Place a coloured background behind them
* More intuitive controls
* More crack!!!!
