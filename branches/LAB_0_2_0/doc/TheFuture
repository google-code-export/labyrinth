Labyrinth - Future Work
---------

I'm following the "cairo" model here.  Basically, the new version will be released when the "Required Features" are in place, in a usable form.  Any "Desired Features" are a plus.  New "Required" and "Desired" features are made very near release of previous version.

Older Versions (overview of pervious versions of this file):

v0.1
----

Version 0.1 of Labyrinth was all about getting a basic working thing.

Loading and saving work and not a lot else.

v0.2
----

Required Features:
✓* Beginnings of a "drawing" thought
✓* Icon and menu entry
✓* Beginning of i18n support
In Addition:
✓* ImageThought.  To add images from file.



Current Goals (V0.3 hopefully)
-------------

Required Features:
    General
* Exporting of maps to png, ps
* Select multiple thoughts
* Hiding / Showing of thoughts
* Extended info on all thoughts
    Text Thought
* Selection of chunks of text
    Drawing Thought
* Deletion of selected points
    
Desired Features:
* New Toolbar (at bottom of window?)
  - In drawing mode
    - Allows selection of pen width, pen colour
  - In text edit mode
    - Allows selection of text size / colour
  - Probably other uses
  - Not necessarily all implemented though
* Make window into infinite-scrollable if desired
* Remember maximised state
* Import from kdissert (in first instance)
* Popup menus in canvas

Carried over from 0.2:
* Alternate text sizes
  - Ideally, text should (in the first instance) follow the theme size
  - Additional text sizes available from a drop-down list
* Follow theme
  - Should check which theme is running and follow the colours defined in it
* Colourful thoughts
  - Should be able to select fg / bg colours for thoughts
* Accessibility
  - Figure out a way to display all the thoughts in a completely accessible way
  - Use a tree-view?
  - Figure out how to make thoughts actually add (accessibly) to the map area


To infinity and beyond
----------------------

Some ideas for later versions.  These are planned for some point, just not right now.

* Export
  - Export maps as png / pdf / print / XML
  - Allow import as well (from XML)
* Different thought types
  - "Elegant" (only 2 sides have thin border), "Jazzy" (huge great spikes out of it), cloud (fluffy) etc.
    > I know what they look like in my head and thats enough for me
* Grouping of thoughts
  - Select multiple thoughts (Started in 0.3?)
  - Place a coloured background behind them
* More intuitive controls
* More crack!!!!
